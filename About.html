        <article id="About">
            <p>Hello, it is I, Todd--I mean, John Smith.</p>

            <p>You are probably intimidated by my vast intellect when it comes to medicinal knowledge. 
            However, I had very humble beginnings, just like yourself. I went to school, came home, 
            and played Skyrim.</p>
            
            <p>My qualifications are many, reflecting my brilliance (and ego). 
            I have saved gamers across the globe with my miracle cures, spreading my fame far and wide.</p>
            
            <p>So what are you waiting for? Buy from John Smith’s Miracle Emporium! It just works!</p>

    <article id="BackStory">
        <p>One day, as I was coming home from chess club, I found my second cousin 
        in his car, which was crashed into a ditch. While driving over to hang out with the family, 
        he had a heart attack. In desperation to save my treasured family, I chucked my copy of Skyrim 
        at his chest. Miraculously, he took a deep breath and woke up! I realized I had a gift, and 
        dedicated my life towards helping others.</p>

    <!--Get Skyrim-->
    <blockquote>
        <p>Skyrim is the best game of this generation--nay, of HISTORY! It has everything that any gamer would want. 
            It has an absolutely massive game world chock full of content. There is no game with more 
            content than Skyrim, and that’s a promise. The world has so many different environments, 
            from woodlands, to snow, to snowy woodlands, to snow on mountains, to more snow. Skyrim also 
            mixes in realism with its fantasy. Players can spend hours levelling up their sneak level and 
            STILL get seen by an enemy five miles away, just like real life! On top of that, its realism also 
            accounts for weight. You can carry eighteen greatswords and it would still be a third of your carry 
            limit, but your other two-thirds will be taken up by hundreds of apples. And when you max out your 
            weight limit, instead of just letting you drop some stuff off simply and easily, you have to walk for 
            4 hours back home so you don’t have to drop your enchanted dwarven bow. Excellent game design. Skyrim 
            has many unpredictable factors, much like the world we live in. For instance, you can have a group of 
            half-naked deer people throw boulders on you because you entered their five-mile view radius. You can 
            even try to go fishing and proceed to get eaten to death by crabs. When you play Skyrim, the line between 
            reality and fiction is truly blurred. And let’s not forget, Skyrim is the only game is existence where the 
            bugs are actually features. Skyrim rewards the player for smart thinking by allowing them to clip through any 
            wall in the game with nothing but a bowl. In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the greatest, most 
            innovative video game ever made and will keep its title until the end of time.</p>
