        <p>Hello, it is I, Todd--I mean, John Smith.</p>

        <p>You are probably intimidated by my vast intellect when it comes to medicinal knowledge. 
        However, I had very humble beginnings, just like yourself. I went to school, came home, 
        and played Skyrim.</p>
        
        <p>My qualifications are many, reflecting my brilliance (and ego). 
        I have saved gamers across the globe with my miracle cures, spreading my fame far and wide.</p>
        
        <p>So what are you waiting for? Buy from John Smithâ€™s Miracle Emporium! It just works!</p>

    <article id="BackStory">
        <p>One day, as I was coming home from chess club, I found my second cousin 
        in his car, which was crashed into a ditch. While driving over to hang out with the family, 
        he had a heart attack. In desperation to save my dear family, I chucked my copy of Skyrim 
        at his chest. Miraculously, he took a deep breath and woke up! I realized I had a gift, and 
        dedicated my life towards helping others.</p>
