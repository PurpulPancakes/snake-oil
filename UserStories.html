    <!--Some stories of people using our products that cured things that they had-->
    <blockquote>
        <p>I was just walking one day and then all of a sudden I was shot by a 
        man who had a mustache then ran off down the alley then minutes later 
        a handsome man who name was Todd Howard came to me to help. I was on the 
        verge of death but he said fear not I came to save your life with this. 
        He pulls a Jar of water he said to drink then after one sip I was healed. 
        It stopped the bleeding and my wounds were closed he said that was the famous 
        Todd Howard bathwater he said that this was sold by a handsome man who sold 
        many Snake oils that saved many of his name was John Smith. Todd Howard didnâ€™t 
        know how this has got his bathwater but he is saving many so buy it from it.</p>
